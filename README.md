# Neuro-Symbolic Image QA

**Author: Yutong Wu**

## Overview

This repository contains a federated neuro-symbolic pipeline model designed for solving Image Question Answering (ImageQA) tasks. The implementation combines the power of dense captioning and reverse image search using the LangChain Library in Python.

## Features

- **Dense Captioning**: Our model can generate descriptive captions for images, providing valuable insights into their content.

- **Reverse Image Search**: It allows users to perform reverse image searches, finding similar images within a given dataset.

## Installation

To use this tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/neuro-symbolic-image-qa.git
   cd neuro-symbolic-image-qa
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main script to start the ImageQA application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Here's how you can use the Neuro-Symbolic Image QA tool:

1. Import your image dataset into the system.
2. Ask questions about the images using natural language queries.
3. Get detailed and descriptive answers about the images, thanks to our dense captioning capabilities.
4. Utilize the reverse image search function to find visually similar images in the dataset.
